# ZoomClassLauncher
This is an code which gives you notifications about 25 minutes before your class starts. Then after 25 minutes the code launches zoom with your class' link.

## User Stories

The following functionality is complete:

* [x] User gets notification on the side of their screen 25 minutes before class starts.
* [x] User's class is launched after 25 minutes of the notification
* [x] User doesnt need to keep in track of the class the code does it for them. 

## Notes

I did this code so i didnt have to follow my class times, but my computers start making noises after 20 minutes the code starts running. So its best to not leave it running.
